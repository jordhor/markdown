# Markdown guide

[Text styles](#text-style) | [Headings](#headings) | [Paragraphs](#paragraphs) | [Lists](#lists) | [Code blocks](#code-blocks) | [Links](#links) | [Images](#images) | [Tables](#tables)

Markdown was created by John Gruber in 2004. Itâ€™s meant to be an easy to read and write syntax which converts easily to HTML (and now many other formats as well).

### HTML Elements

Markdown is a superset of HTML, so any HTML file is valid Markdown.

<pre>&lt;!--This means we can use HTML elements in Markdown, such as the comment 
element, and they won't be affected by a markdown parser. However, if you 
create an HTML element in your markdown file, you cannot use markdown syntax 
within that element's contents.--&gt;</pre>

### Text styles:

Markdown | Rendered
:-- | :--
```This text has *emphasis*.``` | This text has *emphasis*.
```This text **is bold**.``` | This text **is bold**.
```This text ***is emphasized and bold***.``` | This text ***is emphasized and bold***.
```This text ~~is strikethrough.~~``` | This text ~~is strikethrough.~~
```Indicate a `code block`.``` | Indicate a `code block`.
```<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd>``` | <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd>

<br />


### Headings

Markdown | Rendered
:-- | :--
```# This is a title``` | <h1>This is a title  &lt;h1&gt;</h1>
```## This is a title``` | <h2>This is a title  &lt;h2&gt;</h2>
```### This is a title``` | <h3>This is a title  &lt;h3&gt;</h3>
```#### This is a title``` | <h4>This is a title  &lt;h4&gt;</h4>
```##### This is a title``` | <h5>This is a title  &lt;h5&gt;</h5>
```###### This is a title``` | <h6>This is a title  &lt;h6&gt;</h6>

Another alternative for heading is type:
<pre>This is an h1<br />=============</pre>
<pre>This is an h2<br />-------------</pre>

<br />


### Paragraphs

You can end a paragraph with two or more spaces and then begin a new paragraph. 

You can also use ```<br />```.

#### Blockquotes

```
> This is a block quote.
```
<blockquote>This is a block quote.</blockquote>

```
> You can also use more than one level
>> of indentation?
```
<blockquote>You can also use more than one level<blockquote>of indentation?</blockquote></blockquote>

#### Horizontal rules

To break up sections of a document you may want to include a horizontal rule. Three or more dashes on a line will do it. Instead of `-` you could also use `*` or `_`.

```

### Lists

Lists come in two varieties, unordered (bulleted) and ordered (numbered). 
Use lines starting with asterisks (```*```) to create unordered lists, and lines 
starting with ```#.``` to create numbered lists.

#### Unordered lists
```
* This is an unordered lists
* The asterisks are turned into bullets
    * Indenting an item makes a sub list
```
<ul><li>This is an unordered lists</li><li>The asterisks are turned into bullets<ul><li>Indenting an item makes a sub list</li></ul></li></ul>

#### Ordered lists

```
1. This is an ordered lists
1. The 1 are turned into numbers
    1. Indenting an item makes a sub list
```
<ol><li>This is an ordered lists</li><li>The 1 are turned into numbers<ol><li>Indenting an item makes a sub list</li></ol></li></ol>

#### With Boxes

<pre>
- [ ] First task to complete.
- [ ] Second task that needs done
- [x] This task has been completed
</pre>

- [ ] First task to complete.
- [ ] Second task that needs done
- [x] This task has been completed

<br />


### Code blocks

Inline code can be created using the backtick character ``` ` ```:

Markdown | Rendered
:-- | :--
```What the `go_to()` function did!``` | What the `go_to()` function did!

You can indicate a code block (which uses the &lt;code&gt; element) by indenting a line with four spaces or a tab.

<pre class="code">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is code<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is this</pre> 

In GitHub Flavored Markdown, you can use a special syntax for code indicating one of the [supported languages](http://www.rubycoloredglasses.com/2013/04/languages-supported-by-github-flavored-markdown/).

<pre style="padding-bottom: 6px;">```html
&lt;div class="container"&gt;
    &lt;a href="https://api.ggogle.com"&gt;Google Api&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
```</pre>

```html
<div class="container">
    <a href="https://api.ggogle.com">Google Api</a>
</div>
```
An example with another language

<pre style="padding-bottom: 6px;">```javascript
var bar = function() {
    console.log('Hello World!');
}
```</pre>

```javascript
var bar = function() {
    console.log('Hello World!');
}
```
<br />


### Links

Markdown | Rendered
:-- | :--
```Click [this link](http://test.com/).``` | Click [this link](http://test.com/).
```Click [this link](http://test.com/ "Link to Test.com").``` | Click [this link](http://test.com/ "Link to Test.com").
```<http://test.com/>``` equivalent to ```[http://test.com/](http://test.com/)``` | [http://test.com/](http://test.com/)
```Auto-link for email: <foo@bar.co>``` | Auto-link for email: <foo@bar.com>.
```Click this [relative link](../img/ball.png).``` | Click this [relative link](../img/ball.png).

Markdown also supports reference style links. Declare using ```:``` after link name (you must omit parenthesis for url):

[foo]: http://bar.biz/ "Cool!"

Markdown | Rendered
:-- | :--
```[foo]: http://bar.biz/ "Cool!"```<br />```Click [this link][foo] for more details.``` | Click [this link][foo] for more details.

### Bookmarks

You can bookmark any heading (paragraph starting with `#`) converting title in lowercase and replacing spaces by `-`.

Markdown | Rendered
:-- | :--
```Link to section [Code blocks](#code-blocks).``` | Link to section [Code blocks](#code-blocks).

<br />


### Images

Images are done the same way as links but with an exclamation point in front!

Markdown | Rendered
:-- | :--
```![This is the alt-attribute](https://static.com/ball8.png "An optional title")``` | ![This is the alt-attribute](https://github.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/icons/emoji/8ball.png?v5 "An optional title")

```html
<img alt="This is the alt-attribute" src="https://static.com/ball8.png" title="An optional title" />
```
And reference style works as expected.

<pre><b>[myimage]</b>: https://static.com/ball8.png "An optional title"

![This is the alt-attribute]<b>[myimage]</b></pre>


<br />


### Tables

Tables are only available in GitHub Flavored Markdown and are slightly cumbersome, but if you really want it:

<pre>| Col1         | Col2     | Col3          |
| :----------- | :------: | ------------: |
| Left-aligned | Centered | Right-aligned |
| blah         | blah     | blah          |</pre>

| Col1         | Col2     | Col3          |
| :----------- | :------: | ------------: |
| Left-aligned | Centered | Right-aligned |
| blah         | blah     | blah          |

or, for the same results

<pre>Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**</pre>
